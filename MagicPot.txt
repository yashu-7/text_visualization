Once upon a time, in a small village, there lived a farmer named Tom. One day, 
he found a strange-looking pot in his field. He brought it home and discovered it was a magic pot.
Anything he put inside the pot would double!
Tom put an apple in the pot, and to his surprise, two apples came out. He then tried with a coin,
and got two coins back. Excited, Tom kept doubling his coins until he had many.
But Tom’s neighbor, Ben, grew curious and jealous. One night, 
he sneaked into Tom’s house and saw the magic pot. 
Ben decided to steal the pot for himself.
The next morning, Tom discovered his pot was gone. He was sad but realized he still had the wealth he made from the pot. 
Ben, on the other hand, used the pot greedily. He wanted more and more, and one night, 
in his greed, he accidentally fell into the pot. The pot doubled him, and now there were two Bens!
The village learned about the magic pot and Ben’s greed. Ben had to live with his doubled-self, always reminded of his greed.
