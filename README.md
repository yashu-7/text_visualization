# Text Visualization

### How the package works
* Takes in path to file from cli
* Magic pot is a story taken from google
* Example
```
cargo run MagicPot.txt
```
* Preprocessing
    1. Removes punctuations like ",.\!?"
    2. Converts all the words to lower case
* Puts the words and their occurances into a Hashmap

#### Future updates
* To visualize it on a graph
